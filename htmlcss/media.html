    <h1>Combining media queries</h1>
<p>You can use lots of different CSS units in your media queries. If your content is mostly image-based, pixels might make the most sense. If your content is mostly text-based, it probably makes more sense to use a unit thatâ€™s based on text size, like `rem` or `em`</p>
<p>You can also combine media queries to apply more than one condition. Use the word `and` to combine your media queries.</p>
<p>In this example, the background color will change but only when the viewport width is between <code>50em</code> and <code>60em</code>.</p>
